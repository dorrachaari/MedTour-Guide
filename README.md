# MedTour-Guide
This project aims to develop a Ranking algorithm which allows to classify medical tourism agencies according to criteria (features) collected from their 
website extracted dynamically by web crawling algorithm. This ranking is based on a score given to each agency and predicted by applying Fuzzy Logic algorithms.  The interface is created using the python framework Flask.
